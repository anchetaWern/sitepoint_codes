[![Flattr this git repo](http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png)](https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=wernancheta&url=https://github.com/anchetaWern/sitepoint_codes&title=sitepoint-codes&language=php&tags=github&category=software)


##Sitepoint Codes

Code samples and demos from [my articles on Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/author/wancheta/).


Note: I'm no longer actively pushing in this repo since most of the codes in each article now live in their own repo. And the repo is being [forked by Sitepoint](https://github.com/sitepoint-editors) once the article is published.
